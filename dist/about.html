I am currently a college student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela. While taking my course, I’m always eager to learn more about software development, being inspired by the possibilities attainable in these modern technologies.</p><p>As of now, I don’t really know what type of developer I will pursue. One thing I do know is that I’m more into backend side of things, rather than the front-end. Despite that, I still try to make my own projects from time to time, trying out frameworks for mobile and web development.</p><p>I do agree on a quote I heard about being an aspiring developer, and that is:</p><blockquote>"Don’t learn to code. Instead, code to learn."</blockquote><p>And so, instead of only reading documentations and watching tutorial videos to learn, the better way to learn is just to start coding. That’s what I believe in, and what became my inspiration to create more.</p></div><script src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
