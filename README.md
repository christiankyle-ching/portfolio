# Hi, I'm Kyle!
This is the repository of my personal portfolio that can be viewed [here](https://christiankyleching.imfast.io/).

## Technologies Used
For this website, I used the following languages and technologies:
+ HTML, Sass, JavaScript
+ [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/)
+ [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### A brief self background
I'm currently a student at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (started 2018). While taking my course, I'm learning different programming-related technologies and trying them out to make my own programs. And with this recent pandemic situation, I have been more into continuously learning and improving my skills, and hope you can look at some of my works!
