# Hi, I'm Kyle!
This is the repository of my portfolio that can be viewed [here](https://christiankyleching.imfast.io/).

## Technologies Used
For this website, I used the following languages and technologies:
+ HTML, Sass, JavaScript
+ [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/)
+ [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### A brief self background
I'm currently a student at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (started 2018). While taking my course, I'm learning different programming-related technologies and trying them out to make my own programs. And with this recent pandemic situation, I have been more into continuously learning and improving my skills, and hope you can look at some of my works!

### Works and Contributions
1. __Budget Planner__
  * A simple budget planner that I made using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)/[Angular](https://angular.io/) stack. While starting to learn about Ionic, it has come to my idea to make a relatively simple budget planner/tracking app targeted for highschool students that hopefully, they can use to track their allowances and expenses, and might encourage them to save some of their money.
  
2. __School Online Content Management System__
  * A yet another simple website using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)/[Python](https://www.python.org/) stack. As I have been eager to learn Python, I have stumbled upon the Django framework and has integrated it with [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/) to host uploaded files by the users. It also has some basic user registration functionality, as well as password reset sent through email.
  
3. __Edzer Studio Schedule Management System__
  * This is a group project that I made together with a team, as a requirement for one of my database-related subjects on my 2nd year. Along with a planned database schema, an interview with [Edzer Music Studio](https://www.facebook.com/EDZERSTUDIO/), this **WPF application** (C# and MySQL served on XAMPP) features a scheduling system with fees computation based on hours and intrument rentals, intrument management, and a user panel for the administrator to assign other users with less privileges to the system.
